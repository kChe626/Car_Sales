# Car Sales Data Cleaning, SQL Analysis & Tableau Dashboard

This project focuses on cleaning and analyzing car sales data from 2022 to 2023 using SQL and then visualizing key insights in a Tableau dashboard. After detecting and fixing any data quality issues such as duplicates, missing values, or inconsistent fieldsâ€”the cleaned dataset was loaded into MySQL where SQL queries explored monthly sales trends, top-performing car models, and city-level revenue. Key metrics such as current-year-to-date (CYTD) total sales, prior-year-to-date (PYTD) sales, and year-over-year growth were calculated to highlight overall performance. The Tableau dashboard further refines these insights by displaying metrics like total sales by company, body type breakdown, and model price distribution.

## Project Overview

- **Data Cleaning & Preparation**: 
  - Raw car sales data is imported into MySQL.
  - SQL queries are used to remove duplicates, address missing values, and standardize data formats.

- **SQL Analysis**:
  - Analysis includes:
    - Payment methods and transaction counts.
    - Highest-rated categories by branch.
    - Busiest days and monthly trends.
    - Revenue and profit calculations, including year-over-year comparisons.

- **Tableau Dashboard**  
  - An interactive dashboard displays metrics such as:
    - **CYTD Total Sales** vs. **PYTD Total Sales**  
    - **Year-over-Year Sales Growth**  
    - **Total Sales by Company**  
    - **Car Sold by Month**  
    - **Body Type Sales**
    - **Model Price Sold**

## Technologies Used

- **MySQL**: For data cleaning and analysis.
- **Tableau**: For creating the interactive dashboard.

## SQL Analysis Overview

Some key SQL queries include:

- **Payment Methods & Transactions**
  ```sql
  SELECT payment_method, COUNT(*) as no_payments, SUM(quantity) as no_qty_sold
  FROM car_sales
  GROUP BY payment_method;
  ```

- **Highest-Rated Category per Branch**
  ```sql
  SELECT branch, category, AVG(rating) as avg_rating
  FROM car_sales
  GROUP BY branch, category
  ORDER BY branch, avg_rating DESC;
  ```

- **Busiest Day per Branch**
  ```sql
  SELECT branch, DATE_FORMAT(STR_TO_DATE(`date`, '%d/%m/%y'), '%W') AS day_name, COUNT(*) AS no_transactions
  FROM car_sales
  GROUP BY branch, day_name
  ORDER BY branch, no_transactions DESC;
  ```

- **Revenue Decrease Year-over-Year**
  ```sql
  WITH revenue_2022 AS (
    SELECT branch, SUM(total) AS revenue
    FROM car_sales
    WHERE EXTRACT(YEAR FROM STR_TO_DATE(date, '%d/%m/%y')) = 2022
    GROUP BY branch
  ),
  revenue_2023 AS (
    SELECT branch, SUM(total) AS revenue
    FROM car_sales
    WHERE EXTRACT(YEAR FROM STR_TO_DATE(date, '%d/%m/%y')) = 2023
    GROUP BY branch
  )
  SELECT 
    r2.branch,
    r2.revenue AS last_year_revenue,
    r3.revenue AS current_year_revenue,
    ROUND((r2.revenue - r3.revenue) / r2.revenue * 100, 2) AS revenue_difference_percentage
  FROM revenue_2022 r2
  JOIN revenue_2023 r3 ON r2.branch = r3.branch
  WHERE r2.revenue > r3.revenue
  ORDER BY revenue_difference_percentage DESC;
  ```

## Tableau Dashboard

Below is a preview of the Tableau dashboard created for this project:

**Dashboard Highlights**:
- **CYTD vs. PYTD Total Sales**: Compares current year-to-date and prior year-to-date sales.  
- **Monthly Sales Trend**: Shows how sales fluctuate over time.  
- **Top Companies**: Breaks down which manufacturers or companies are performing best.  
- **Body Type & Model Price Analysis**: Insights into the types of cars (SUV, Sedan, etc.) and their price ranges.
